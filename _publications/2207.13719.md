## Abstract
We explore the celestial holography proposal for non-trivial asymptotically flat backgrounds including the Coulomb field of a static and spinning point charge, their gravitational counterparts described by the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, as well as the Aichelburg-Sexl shockwave and spinning shockwave geometries and their electromagnetic cousins. We compute celestial two-point amplitudes on these Kerr-Schild type backgrounds which have the desirable feature, due to the presence of an external source, that they are non-vanishing for general operator positions and are not constrained by the kinematic delta functions of flat space celestial CFT correlators. Of particular interest is the case of shockwave backgrounds where the two-point scattering amplitude of massless scalars can be interpreted as a standard CFT three-point correlator between two massless asymptotic states and a conformal primary shockwave operator. We furthermore show that the boundary on-shell action for general backgrounds becomes the generating functional for tree-level correlation functions in celestial CFT. Finally, we derive (conformal) Faddeev-Kulish dressings for particle-like backgrounds which remove all infrared divergent terms in the two-point functions to all orders in perturbation theory.
