## Abstract
With the aim of computing bound waveforms from scattering amplitudes, we explore gravitational two-body dynamics using the Schwinger-Dyson equations and Bethe-Salpeter recursion. We show that the tree-level scattering waveform admits a natural analytic continuation, in rapidity, to the bound waveform, which we confirm from an independent calculation, in the Post-Newtonian expansion, of the time-domain multipoles at large eccentricity. We demonstrate consistency of this scattering-to-bound map with the Damour-Deruelle prescription for orbital elements in the quasi-Keplerian parametrization (which enters into the evaluation of the multipoles) and with the analytic continuation, in the binding energy, of radiated energy and angular momentum at 3PM.
