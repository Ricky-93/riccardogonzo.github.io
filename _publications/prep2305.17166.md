## Abstract
We study the space and properties of global and local observables for radiation emitted in the scattering of a massive scalar field in gauge and gravitational plane-wave backgrounds, in both the quantum and classical theory. We first compute the radiated momentum and angular momentum flow, demonstrating that they are good local observables determined by the amplitude and phase of the waveform. We then focus on the corresponding global observables, which in the gravitational case requires dealing with the collinear divergence of the gravitational Compton cross-section. We show using the KLN theorem that we can obtain an infrared-finite cross-section only by summing over forward scattering diagrams; this suggests dressing the initial state in the direction collinear to the plane wave in order to be able to compute observables integrated over the celestial sphere. Finally, we explore the high-energy behaviour of our observables. We find that classical global observables generically exhibit a power-law mass divergence in electrodynamics and a logarithmic mass divergence in gravity, even when radiation reaction is included. We then show explicitly how this is consistently resolved in the full quantum theory.
