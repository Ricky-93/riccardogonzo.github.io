## Abstract
We establish a new relation between classical observables for scattering and bound orbits of a massive probe particle in a Kerr background. We find an exact representation of the Hamilton-Jacobi action in terms of the conserved charges which admits an analytic continuation, both for the radial and polar contribution, for a general class of geodesics beyond the equatorial case. Remarkably, this allows to extend the boundary to bound dictionary and it provides an efficient method to compute the deflection angles and the time delay for scattering orbits, as well as frequency ratios for bound orbits, in the probe limit but at all orders in the perturbative expansion.
